Night has brought to those who sleep Only dreams they cannot keep I have legends in the deep Paint the sky with stars  Who has placed the midnight sky?

      " \"Thank You, Stars (New Version)\"  Some call it faith, some call it love. Some call it guidance from above. You are the reason we found ours, So thank you stars.  Some people think it's far away, Some know it's with them everyday. You are the reason we found ours, So thank you stars.  There are no winds that can blow it away on the air, When they try to blow it away 's when you know it will always be there.  To some it's the strength to be apart, To some it's a feeling in the heart. And when you're out there on your own, it's the way back home.  There are no winds that can blow it away on the air, When they try to blow it away 's when you know it will always be there. Some call it faith, some call it love. Some call it guidance from above. You are the reason we found ours, So thank you stars. Thank you stars, Thank you stars, Thank you stars\n"

Chorus The killer's breed or the demon's seed, The glamour, the fortune, the pain, Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain, But don't you pray for my soul anymore. 2 minutes to midnight The hands that threaten doom. 2 minutes to midnight To kill the unborn in the womb.  The blind men shout let the creatures out We'll show the unbelievers The napalm screams of human flames Of a prime time belsen feast... yeah! As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy, We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.  Chorus  The body bags and little rags of children torn in two And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you. As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song, To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.  Chorus  Midnight... all night...\n"

They leave that role to the poor  Time will tell on their power minds Making war just for fun Treating people just like pawns in chess Wait 'til their judgement day comes Yeah!

That means he's lost the will to live I'm so lonesome I could cry \n"

Broken bottles under children's feet Bodies strewn across the dead end street But I won't heed the battle call It puts my back up Puts my back up against the wall  Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday  And the battle's just begun There's many lost, but tell me who has won The trench is dug within our hearts And mothers, children, brothers, sisters Torn apart  Sunday, Bloody Sunday Sunday, Bloody Sunday  How long... How long must we sing this song How long, how long... 'cause tonight... We can be as one Tonight... Tonight...

Talking aloud as they sit round their tables, Scattering flowers washed down by the rain. Stood by the gate at the foot of the garden, Watching them pass like clouds in the sky, Try to cry out in the heat of the moment, Possessed by a fury that burns from inside.  Cry like a child, though these years make me older, With children my time is so wastefully spent, A burden to keep, though their inner communion, Accept like a curse an unlucky deal. Played by the gate at the foot of the garden, My view stretches out from the fence to the wall, No words could explain, no actions determine, Just watching the trees and the leaves as they fall.\n"

A, I was born in the U. S. A I was born in the U. S. A, born in the U. S.

Man He said son, don't you understand  I had a brother at Khe Sahn Fighting off the Viet Cong They're still there, he's all gone  He had a woman he loved in Saigon I got a picture of him in her arms now  Down in the shadow of the penitentiary Out by the gas fires of the refinery I'm ten years burning down the road Nowhere to run aint got nowhere to go  Born in the U.

      " \"The Lady Of Shalott\"  On either side of the river lie Long fields of barley and of rye, That clothe the world and meet the sky; And thro' the field the road run by To many-towered Camelot; And up and down the people go, Gazing where the lilies blow Round an island there below, The island of Shalott.  Willows whiten, aspens quiver, Little breezes dusk and shiver Thro' the wave that runs for ever By the island in the river Flowing down to Camelot. Four grey walls, and four grey towers, Overlook a space of flowers, And the silent isle imbowers The Lady of Shalott.  Only reapers, reaping early, In among the bearded barley Hear a song that echoes cheerly From the river winding clearly Down to tower'd Camelot; And by the moon the reaper weary, Piling sheaves in uplands airy, Listening, whispers \"'tis the fairy The Lady of Shalott.\"  There she weaves by night and day A magic web with colours gay, She has heard a whisper say, A curse is on her if she stay To look down to Camelot. She knows not what the curse may be, And so she weaveth steadily, And little other care hath she, The Lady of Shalott.  And moving through a mirror clear That hangs before her all the year, Shadows of the world appear. There she sees the highway near Winding down to Camelot; And sometimes thro' the mirror blue The Knights come riding two and two. She hath no loyal Knight and true, The Lady Of Shalott.  But in her web she still delights To weave the mirror's magic sights, For often thro' the silent nights A funeral, with plumes and lights And music, went to Camelot; Or when the Moon was overhead, Came two young lovers lately wed. \"I am half sick of shadows,\" said The Lady Of Shalott.  A bow-shot from her bower-eaves, He rode between the barley sheaves, The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves, And flamed upon the brazen greaves Of bold Sir Lancelot. A red-cross knight for ever kneel'd To a lady in his shield, That sparkled on the yellow field, Beside remote Shalott.  His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd; On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode; From underneath his helmet flow'd His coal-black curls as on he rode, As he rode back to Camelot. From the bank and from the river He flashed into the crystal mirror, \"Tirra Lirra,\" by the river Sang Sir Lancelot.  She left the web, she left the loom, She made three paces taro' the room, She saw the water-lily bloom, She saw the helmet and the plume, She looked down to Camelot. Out flew the web and floated wide; The mirror cracked from side to side; \"The curse is come upon me,\" cried The Lady of Shalott.  In the stormy east-wind straining, The pale yellow woods were waning, The broad stream in his banks complaining. Heavily the low sky raining Over towered Camelot; Down she came and found a boat Beneath a willow left afloat, And round about the prow she wrote The Lady of Shalott  And down the river's dim expanse Like some bold seer in a trance, Seeing all his own mischance - With a glassy countenance Did she look to Camelot. And at the closing of the day She loosed the chain and down she lay; The broad stream bore her far away, The Lady of Shalott.  Heard a carol, mournful, holy, Chanted loudly, chanted lowly, Till her blood was frozen slowly, And her eyes were darkened wholly, Turn'd to towered Camelot. For ere she reach'd upon the tide The first house by the water-side, Singing in her song she died, The Lady of Shalott.  Under tower and balcony, By garden-wall and gallery, A gleaming shape she floated by, Dead-pale between the houses high, Silent into Camelot. Out upon the wharfs they came, Knight and Burgher, Lord and Dame, And round the prow they read her name, The Lady of Shalott.  Who is this? And what is here? And in the lighted palace near Died the sound of royal cheer; And they crossed themselves for fear, All the Knights at Camelot; But Lancelot mused a little space He said, \"She has a lovely face; God in his mercy lend her grace, The Lady of Shalott.\"\n"

One told me of China Roses, One a thousand nights and one night, Earth's last picture, the end of evening Hue of indigo and blue.  A new moon leads me to Woods of dreams and I follow. A new world waits for me; My dream, my way.  I know that if I have heaven There is nothing to desire. Rain and river, a world of wonder May be paradise to me.\n"

Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and  You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You betterâ€¦  His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping This world is mine for the taking, make me king As we move toward a New World Order A normal life is boring; but superstardom's Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father He goes home and barely knows his own daughter But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product They moved on to the next schmoe who flows He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner But the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da  You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You betterâ€¦  No more games, I'ma change what you call rage Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper All the pain inside amplified by the Fact that I can't get by with my 9-to-5 And I can't provide the right type of life for my family 'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not This may be the only opportunity that I got  You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You better lose yourself in the music The moment, you own it, you better never let it go (go) You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo You betterâ€¦  You can do anything you set your mind to, man\n"

Gloomy Sunday  Gloomy is Sunday, With shadows I spend it all My heart and I Have decided to end it all Soon there'll be candles And prayers that are said I know Let them not weep Let them know that I'm glad to go Death is no dream For in death I'm caressin' you With the last breath of my soul I'll be blessin' you  Gloomy Sunday  Dreaming, I was only dreaming I wake and I find you asleep In the deep of my heart, dear Darling I hope That my dream never haunted you My heart is tellin' you How much I wanted you Gloomy Sunday\n"

How could you throw me right out of your world? So young when the pain had begun Now forever afraid of being loved  Oh, father, please, father I'd love to leave you alone But I can't let you go Oh, father, please, father  Oh, father, please, father Put the bottle down For the love of a daughter For the love of a daughter\n"
